# Awesome Move [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of code and content from the [Move](https://github.com/move-language/move) programming language community.

Move is a programming language for writing safe smart contracts originally developed at Facebook to power the Libra blockchain. Move is designed to be a platform-agnostic language to enable common libraries, tooling, and developer communities across diverse blockchains with vastly different data and execution models. Move's ambition is to become the "JavaScript of web3" in terms of ubiquity--when developers want to quickly write safe code involving assets, it should be written in Move.

### Frameworks

A Move **framework** is the set of Move modules included in the genesis state of the chain. 
These modules typically implement key concepts like accounts, currencies, . 
The ability to separate blockchain-specific framework logic from the generic functionality of the Move language is a key part of Move's platform-agnostic design.

## Papers

### Language Design

- [Move: A Language With Programmable Resources](https://developers.diem.com/papers/diem-move-a-language-with-programmable-resources/2019-06-18.pdf) - This was the original Move white paper released in 2018. Many aspects of this are now out of date (e.g., the syntax and description of the bytecode instructions), but the first two sections are worth a read for explaining the difficulties of programming with assets and how Move tackles them.
